OpenZeppelin Stellar Soroban Contracts is a collection of contracts for the Stellar network. Our goal is to bring Web3 standards under the OpenZeppelin quality by providing a set of high-quality, battle-tested contracts that can be used to build decentralized applications on the Stellar network.


## Project Structure

- `packages/`: Source code
  - `tokens/`: Various token types (fungible, non-fungible, etc.)
  - `contract-utils/`: Utilities for token types (pausable, etc.)
- `examples/`: Example contracts
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `audits/`: Audit reports


## Docs
We have a [documentation website](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/stellar-contracts/) explaining the high-level concepts of the library. You can find code-specific inline documentation in the source code, or alternatively you can locally generate the documentation using the `cargo doc --no-deps --lib --open` command, which will generate the documentation and open it using your default browser.


## Setup

Stellar smart contracts are programs written in Rust leveraging the [Soroban SDK](https://crates.io/crates/soroban-sdk). Please, follow the setup process as outlined in the [Stellar documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup).


## How To Test/Play With Example Contracts
The below section is based on [Official Stellar Docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/hello-world). If you are stuck on any of the steps below, or want to dive in deeper, please refer to the official documentation.

We provide a set of example contracts that demonstrate how to use the library. You can find them in the `examples/` directory. If you want to deploy the example contracts to the testnet and play with them, you can follow the instructions below:
1. `git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts.git`
2. `cd stellar-contracts/examples`
3. Take a look at the current folder, and select an example contract you are interested in. We will go with the `fungible-pausable` in this guide.
4. `cd fungible-pausable`
5. `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
6. Now, the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory will contain the compiled contracts. In this case, `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fungible_pausable_example.wasm` is the compiled wasm file.
7. Deploying to the testnet is no different than any other contract. You can follow the instructions in the [Stellar documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/deploy-to-testnet).


## How To Use This Library As A Dependency

The library has not been published yet to `crates.io`, and this will be the case until we reach a stable version. However, one can [specify a git dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories) in a `Cargo.toml`. We also recommend pinning to a specific commit/tag, because rapid iterations are expected as the library is in an active development phase, like so for:

- **v0.1.0 (audited)**
```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-pausable = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts", tag = "v0.1.0" }
openzeppelin-pausable-macros = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts", tag = "v0.1.0" }
openzeppelin-fungible-token = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts", tag = "v0.1.0" }
```

- **latest**
```toml
[dependencies]
stellar-constants = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-default-impl-macro = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-event-assertion = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-fungible = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-non-fungible = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-pausable = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-pausable-macros = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-upgradeable = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }
stellar-upgradeable-macros = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts" }

```
